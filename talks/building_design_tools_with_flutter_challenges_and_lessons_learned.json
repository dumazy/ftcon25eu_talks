  "description": "Can Flutter go beyond typical mobile apps and handle the complexity of full-featured, professional-grade tools?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll share what I learned while building a design tool entirely in Flutter. From infinite canvases and custom scrolling to keyboard shortcuts, rendering, and architecture decisions, it turns out Flutter can do a lot more than it’s usually given credit for.\r\n\r\nIf you’re working on an internal tool, editor, or any highly interactive UI, this talk will give you practical insights I wish I had when I started.\r\n\r\nKey Takeaways:\r\n1. Building an infinite canvas with smooth interaction\r\n2. Widgets vs CustomPainter: When to use one over the other\r\n3. Handling complex gestures, keyboard shortcuts, and focus without conflicts\r\n4. Mastering coordinate systems and widget positioning in complex UIs\r\n5. A mental model for scaling your UI",
