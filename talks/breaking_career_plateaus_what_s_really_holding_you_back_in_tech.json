  "description": "Tech professionals often hit invisible ceilings—not because of lack of talent, but because of overlooked habits, mindsets, or patterns that quietly stall progress. In this roundtable, we’ll explore the career blockers that many of us carry without realizing it, and share practical, proven strategies for getting unstuck.\r\n\r\nThis will be an open and honest discussion about personal growth in the fast-moving tech world. Expect thoughtful insights, real-world examples, and peer-driven advice on navigating plateaus, overcoming internal resistance, and building momentum.\r\n\r\nWhat are some subtle or surprising habits you’ve seen (or experienced) that can quietly block career growth in tech?\r\nHow do you recognize when you're \"stuck\" in your career—and what signals help you catch it early?\r\nWhat small, consistent changes have made the biggest difference in your personal or professional development?\r\nHow do you balance the pressure to constantly upskill with the need to avoid burnout?\r\nWhat systems (mentorship, feedback loops, journaling, coaching, etc.) have helped you stay intentional about career growth?",
