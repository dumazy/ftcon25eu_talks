  "description": "When 50+ engineers contribute to a rapidly growing codebase, technical debt and executing migrations becomes an organizational challenge.\r\nAt Qonto, we transformed our tech debt management by moving from vague group responsibility to empowering teams with a way to visualize and prioritize their debt, turning \"someone should fix this\" into \"we’re on it.\"\r\nIn this talk, you'll learn how we:\r\n- Built a first prototype in just one month with a single engineer without any new new tools, just clever use of existing APIs\r\n- Integrated it into our day-to-day processes, making tech health a routine\r\n- Designed a Health Score that teams actually want to improve\r\n- Orchestrated large-scale migrations with real-time tracking, no more guessing “are we there yet?”\r\n- Made debt reduction engaging with intuitive tooling and team-specific dashboards\r\n- Expanded the playbook to tackle dependency updates, flaky tests, and beyond\r\nWe’ll also share hard-earned lessons and take a sneak peek at what's next.\r\nJoin us to see how teams like yours can cut tech debt while boosting ownership, starting with what’s already in your toolkit.",
