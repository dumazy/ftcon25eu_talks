  "title": "Simpler state management with Dart on the server and synced databases",
  "videoUrl": "",
  "description": "Local databases like SQLite are a great tool for storing structured data. Together with reactive libraries like Drift, they form a great basis for state management as well.\r\nOnce local data needs to be fetched from or uploaded to a backend however, things become a lot more complicated and require custom cache management. This talk shows how a combination of Dart on the server and realtime sync engines make state management across devices just as easy as state management on a single device.\r\n\r\nKey takeaways of this talk are:\r\n\r\n- How a SQLite database fits into modern state management.\r\n- How Drift can be used to safely share database code between app and backend.\r\n- How sync engines like PowerSync simplify integrating your backend.",
