  "description": "For years, Flutter developers have relied on general-purpose IDEs, great tools, but not built with Flutterâ€™s unique patterns, challenges and workflows in mind. While other ecosystems are getting AI-first, deeply integrated environments, Flutter devs are still stitching together plugins, previews, and command-line tools to stay productive.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we introduce a new Flutter IDE called DreamFlow IDE, an AI integrated IDE built from the ground up for Flutter. It brings a tri-surface development model:\r\n- Code for full control and Dart analyzer fidelity,\r\n- Visual for intuitive layout and styling,\r\n- Agentic for AI-assisted refactors, generation, and testing.\r\n\r\nWith this talk, we learn how to build, debug, and iterate faster an existing Flutter project with the help of the new IDE.",
