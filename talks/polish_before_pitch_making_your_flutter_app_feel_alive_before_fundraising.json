  "description": "You’ve got core functionality. The MVP works. But will your Flutter app feel good enough to wow investors, early users, or potential partners? This roundtable is for Flutter developers who want to add that final layer of polish before fundraising. We'll swap ideas and practical techniques to make your app feel more dynamic, responsive, and professional—even on limited time and budget. From animation tips and haptic feedback to onboarding flow, layout finesse, and perceived performance tricks, let’s talk about what makes a Flutter app feel truly “alive.“ Whether you’re prepping for a demo day or bootstrapping your way toward seed funding, come share what’s worked for you—or what you’re still figuring out.\r\n\r\nWhat visual or UX improvements have made the biggest difference in how polished your Flutter app feels?\r\nHow do you balance time spent on “delight” (animations, transitions, micro-interactions) vs. core features?\r\nWhat tools, packages, or design systems have helped you add polish quickly?\r\nWhat’s your approach to onboarding, loading states, or error handling—especially for demos or investor reviews?\r\nHave you ever received feedback (positive or negative) on the look and feel of your app during early fundraising conversations?",
