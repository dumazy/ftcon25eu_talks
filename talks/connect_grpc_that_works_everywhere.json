  "description": "gRPC is a powerful and efficient technology, but it does not work reliably on the web platform without workarounds such as an Envoy proxy. Connect is a protocol and library that reimagines gRPC to work seamlessly across mobile, web, and server environments.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will introduce the Connect protocol and demonstrate how it enables Flutter and Dart applications to leverage modern, type-safe RPC across all platforms. I will include a live coding session showing how to build a Dart/Flutter client for a Connect-enabled backend, illustrating how this approach aligns with Dartâ€™s \"run everywhere\" philosophy. You will leave with a practical understanding of how to adopt Connect to bring true cross-platform gRPC to your apps.",
