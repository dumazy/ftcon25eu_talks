  "description": "Flutter has entered its second decade -- one in which we are all now building for a world very different than when the project began.  Eric Seidel, former director of Flutter & Dart, and founder of Shorebird, will reflect some on the changing developer landscape, on Flutter & Dart's growing global momentum, Flutter's expanding role in enterprise and the increasing velocity of community-driven development around Dart.  We'll walk through the many exciting things we've seen come out of the Flutter & Dart community this year and what we're betting on for the next few years.",
