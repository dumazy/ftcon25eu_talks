  "description": "In this talk, I’ll share my experience building Twinscreen (twinscreen.app), a Flutter app that lets you share your phone’s screen and stream it live to the web using the WebRTC protocol. You’ll learn not just the “how” but also the “gotchas” of bringing realtime screen sharing into Flutter.\r\n\r\nKey takeaways for the audience:\r\n1. Using the flutter_webrtc package to implement the WebRTC protocol.\r\n2. Capturing and broadcasting a device’s screen in Flutter.\r\n3. Setting up Firebase as a signalling server.\r\n4. Configuring STUN and TURN servers for reliable connectivity.\r\n5. Common pitfalls with WebRTC and how to avoid them.\r\n\r\nWhether you want to build a screen-sharing app, add live collaboration features, or just understand WebRTC better, this session will give you practical insights directly from a production app.",
