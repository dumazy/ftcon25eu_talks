  "description": "Flutter lets us vibe code beautiful apps at lightning speed, but the moment your app needs a backend, the fun often stops. Suddenly, you're juggling languages, DevOps pipelines, and vendor lock-in anxiety. What if you didn't have to?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll explore how to keep the vibe alive by building full-stack features entirely in Dart. You'll see how to create a production-ready backend that feels like an extension of your Flutter app, not a separate world. We'll cover type-safe APIs, modular architecture, real-time updates, and zero-config deployments, all focusing on developer joy.\r\n\r\nWhether you're a solo founder shipping fast or part of a mobile team tired of stitching together backend solutions, you'll leave this session ready to build confidently, scalably, and entirely in Dart.\r\n\r\nLet's vibe code the whole stack.",
