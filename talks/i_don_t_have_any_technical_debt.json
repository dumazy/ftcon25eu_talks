  "description": "I can guess a few things you might be thinking now. Either I am lying, or I just don't know what technical debt is. Or maybe I am just bad at my job and these opinions will blow up in my face a year from now.\r\n\r\nMaybe the last one is true, time will tell! But I think a lot of technical debt is a mindset about your codebase. But over the last two years, we have taken our Android app, used by millions of Norwegians, from a place where you could see its legacy as an SDK to a codebase where we can make changes and add features so quickly it can be inconvenient.\r\n\r\nI think the way we got here is pretty simple: take ownership of your codebase. In this talk, I will explain what that loaded statement means, and how you too can be tech debt free in no time!\r\n\r\n",
