  "videoUrl": "",
  "description": "Managing native dependencies and assets can be complex, often requiring manual steps and intricate build configurations. Enter Dart Build Hooks â€“ a powerful, extensible system designed to automate and streamline native asset integration.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll dive deep into Dart Build Hooks, a feature currently in preview in the Dart and Flutter SDK.\r\n\r\n* You'll learn how to seamlessly incorporate native code and assets into your Dart packages so that they work on a variety of SDKs and frameworks.\r\n* We'll explore the \"Why\": insights into the core design principles of Dart Build Hooks, including the clear separation of responsibilities between the hooks system, asset types, and the SDKs built on Dart.\r\n* You'll discover how it works under the hood: how build hooks work internally, from their extensible JSON protocol to advanced features such as custom asset types.\r\n\r\nWhether you're a package author looking to simplify native asset inclusion or an SDK or framework owner aiming to support SDK-agnostic assets in packages, this talk will equip you with the knowledge to harness the full power of Dart Build Hooks.",
